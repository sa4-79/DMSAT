DMSAT Version 1.0.0 28/09/2013
=============================================================================
GENERAL USAGE NOTES
---------------------
- DMSAT is a sat solver that is developed to run on top of Distributed Resource Management Systems(DRMS). The testing of this version is done using Oracle Grid Engine (OGE).

- Make sure to set the values of required environment variables before running the DMSAT

- Modify the makfiles before building the project and set the values of the lib and include directories 

==============================================================================

DIRECTORY OVERVIEW:

mtl/            Mini Template Library
utils/          Generic helper code (I/O, Parsing, CPU-time, etc)
core/           A core version of the solver
simp/           An extended solver with simplification capabilities
Debug/			Has all building tools and make files.	
workersolver	contains source code of miniSat that is modified to run as worker on remote machines, the environment variable WORKERSOLVER should points to directory 
README
LICENSE

================================================================================
BUILDING:
Modify the following makfiles before building the project and set the values of the lib and include directories.
        - Debug/makefile
        - Debug/core/subdir.mk
        - Debug/utils/subdir.mk
        - Debug/simp/subdir.mk


cd Debug
make all
or
There is an eclipse CDT project file that is provided with this distribution, import the project in eclipse and then you can build it from CDT.
================================================================================
EXAMPLES:
A sample run script run.sh is provided in the Debug directory. Before running DMSAT make sure to set following environment variables.
======================================================================
TIMEOUT To set the value for timeout this is useful for SAT race competitions like mode of runnign where a job is killed after a defined number of seconds.
COHORTSIZE 	Contain the value for the job cohort size
WAITTIME	Setting the value for the wait time before submitting a new cohort of jobs
RAMPUPTIME	Setting the value for initial ramp-up time
WORKERSOLVER	setting the value for the path to the worker solver
OUTPUTFILE	setting the value of temporary output file
After setting the values of the above mentioned environment variable(see Debug/run.sh for sample values), we can run SAT solver as 

./DMSAT <path to the CNF file>
